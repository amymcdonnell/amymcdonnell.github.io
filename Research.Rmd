I study neural correlates of human attention in the lab and in real-world, applied contexts. In one line of research, I utilize electrocardiography (ECG), scalp electroencephalography (EEG), intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), and virtual reality (VR) to study the psychophysiological effects of immersion in different representations of nature on attention, affect, stress, and general health and well-being. In another line of research, I utilize EEG, ECG, driving simulation, and on-road, naturalistic methods to explore driver workload, arousal, and attention when multitasking behind the wheel and operating autonomous vehicles. My research has significant implications for areas such as public health, urban design, technological advancement, transportation safety, and human-automation interactions.  I am interested in the continued development of mobile psychophysiological methods for reliably assessing cognition in the real-world.

## Distracted Driving
My distracted driving research explores the cognitive implications of multitasking behind the wheel. Using behavioral measures, driving simulation technology, naturalistic methods, and on-road ECG and EEG, I explore the impact of multitasking on cognition and driving performance, shedding light on the risks posed by modern technological interfaces in vehicles. My findings underscore the critical need for human factors research, policy interventions, and technological innovations aimed at mitigating the dangers of distracted driving and fostering safer road behaviors.

## Autonomous Vehicles
I also explore how humans interact with automated vehicle technology. Can modern, autonomous vehicles (e.g., Tesla) help overcome the cognitive limitations of error-prone humans? Can automated driving free up time and cognitive resources for humans to allocate to other tasks? Or do human drivers become complacent under automated driving conditions, leading to even more dangerous outcomes such as drivers "zoning out" behind the wheel? To answer these questions, I again utilize mobile EEG, ECG, and detection response tasks to assess driver attention, workload, and arousal during on-road, automated driving.

## Environmental Neuroscience
The over-stimulation, relentless task-switching, and cognitive demands characteristic of our modern, urban environments can quickly lead to stress and mental fatigue. How might we escape and recover from these demanding environments? Can immersion in nature help decrease stress and provide relief from mental fatigue? In my environmental neuroscience work, I utilize electrophysiological methods (ECG, scalp EEG, and intracranial EEG) to understand the impact of exposure to nature (nature images, VR nature, a nature walk, and a multi-day immersion in nature) on stress recovery and attention restoration. This work from the Applied Cognition Lab has been featured in many popular outlets, including but not limited to PBS America Outdoors, National Geographic, Outside Magazine, *The Nature Fix* by Florence Williams, The New York Times, and Times Magazine.

## Community-based Research
I conduct community-based research alongside community partners that are committed to increasing access to nature for all. This work focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of nature-based programming in improving mental health and well-being, with the ultimate goal of making nature more accessible and inclusive,  promoting the health and well-being of *all* community members.
